Based ont the study of Jetty and Undertow as a transport in CXF, we believe that the following classes will have to be implemented for our projects' proof of concept:
Interface ServerEngine
Class TomcatHTTPServerEngine extends ServerEngine
Class TomcatHTTPServerEngineFactory
Class TomcatDestinationFactory
Class TomcatHTTPDestination
Class TomcatHTTPHandler
Class ThreadingParameters

Furthermore, we hope that it will be possible to reuse certain implementations from the other implementations. For example for the interface ServerEngine or for the class ThreadingParameters.

As explained in our previous presentation, we will first write tests that will ensure that every part is working as expected (TDD).
